# EmberConf EmberMap Components training

Hi there!

We're super excited that you're attending our EmberConf components training on Monday. Please follow these instructions to setup your computer with our training app. It should take no more than ten minutes.

We need to install a couple of NPM packages for this training. Since conference center wifi isn't always the most reliable thing it's going to be easier if you can to do the setup at home or work.

# Installation

If you have any trouble with these steps feel free to reach out to us. My email is [ryan@embermap.com](mailto:ryan@embermap.com), Sam's is [sam@embermap.com](mailto:sam@embermap.com), or join us in #topic-embermap on Ember slack.

## Node.js

We're using Node.js version 6.10.1, which is the current LTS version. Any version of node above 4 should work, but if you're getting stuck let us know.

## Training app

Here's how you can install the training app:

1. Open terminal
1. Clone this git repository: `git clone git@github.com:EmberMap/components-training.git`
1. Move into the directory: `cd components-training`
1. Run NPM install: `npm install` (You might get some warnings, thats ok!)
1. Build the app `ember build`
1. You're all set! We'll see you Monday!
